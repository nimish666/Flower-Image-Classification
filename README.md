# Flower-Image-Classification
Image classification is a common and important problem in computer vision, where the goal is to correctly identify the
category to which an image belongs. In this project, the dataset consisted of images of flowers, each of which was
labeled with a specific category among 60 possible classes. I successfully implemented a DenseNet121-based model
to classify images of flowers into 60 different categories and was able to achieve a final test set accuracy of 97.83%.
